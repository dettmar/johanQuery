# miniQuery
A tiny subset of jQuery - not nearly as awesome, but small.

## Methods
On an instanciated object using `$("selector")`, you've got these methods at hand:

* `.find()`
* `.slice()`
* `.splice()`
* `.each()`
* `.map()`
* `.reverse()`
* `.first()`
* `.last()`
* `.eq()`


## Special note
This is only experiment. Me trying learning about how jQuery is working. In other words __do not use this in production!__

## Browser support
IE 8+, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera
